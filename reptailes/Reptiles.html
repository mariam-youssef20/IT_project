        The African spurred tortoise, also called the sulcata tortoise, is an endangered species of tortoise inhabiting the southern 
        edge of the Sahara Desert in Africa. It is the largest mainland species of tortoise in Africa, and the third-largest in the world, 
        after the Gal√°pagos and Aldabra giant tortoises. It is the only living species in its genus (Centrochelys), recognized by its thick, 
        golden-brown scutes and spurs on its hind legs. These resilient reptiles thrive in arid regions, 
        digging extensive burrows up to 10 feet deep to escape extreme heat. Herbivorous by nature, they primarily feed on grasses, 
        leaves, and cacti, storing water in their bodies to survive droughts. Due to habitat destruction and the illegal pet trade, 
        their wild populations are declining rapidly. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs and protected reserves, 
        aim to safeguard this iconic species. Their slow growth and long lifespan (over 70 years) make them particularly vulnerable to 
        environmental changes

      <p>
        The green iguana, also known as the American iguana or the common green iguana, is a large, arboreal, 
        mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana. Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana. 
        The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area; it is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico. 
        These striking reptiles are easily recognized by their vivid green coloration, long tails, and prominent dewlaps. 
        They are excellent climbers, using their sharp claws and strong limbs to navigate forest canopies. Primarily feeding on leaves, 
        flowers, and fruits, they play a key role in seed dispersal. Though adaptable, they face threats from habitat loss and the exotic pet 
        trade.

        The Nile crocodile is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa, where it is present in 26 countries. 
        It is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the eastern, southern, and central regions of the continent, 
        and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshlands. 
        It occasionally inhabits deltas, brackish lakes, and rarely saltwater. Its range once stretched from the Nile Delta throughout 
        the Nile River. Lake Turkana in Kenya has one of the largest undisturbed Nile crocodile populations. 
        These apex predators can grow over 6 meters long and weigh up to 1,000 kg, using their powerful jaws to ambush prey like fish,
        birds, and mammals. They play a crucial ecological role by controlling fish populations and scavenging carcasses,
        maintaining ecosystem balance. Despite their fearsome reputation, they face threats from habitat loss and illegal hunting for
          their valuable skin.

    <div class="card snake">

      <p>
        The corn snake', sometimes called red rat snake is a species of North American rat snake in the family Colubridae. 
        The species subdues its small prey by constriction. It is found throughout the southeastern and central United States. 
        Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, 
        the corn snake lacks functional venom and is harmless. 
        The corn snake is beneficial to humans because it helps to control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease.

    <div class="card komodo">

      <p>
        The Komodo dragon is the largest living lizard on Earth, growing up to 10 feet long and weighing over 150 pounds.
        Found only on a few Indonesian islands, including Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Padar, this apex predator dominates its ecosystem
         with a combination of brute strength, sharp claws, and a deadly bite. Unlike most reptiles, Komodo dragons are active hunters,
         capable of taking down large prey such as deer, wild boar, and even water buffalo. 
         Their saliva contains toxic bacteria, and recent research has confirmed they also possess venom glands, 
         making their bite a slow but lethal weapon that weakens prey over time. These massive lizards have an excellent sense of smell,
         using their forked tongues to detect carrion or injured animals from miles away. Despite their fearsome reputation,
         Komodo dragons are surprisingly agile swimmers and climbers when necessary.
         They are also cannibalistic, with adults sometimes preying on younger dragons. Due to habitat loss, human encroachment,
         and a limited natural range, Komodo dragons are classified as endangered, with conservation efforts in place to protect these 
         ancient reptiles. Living up to 30 years in the wild, they remain one of the most fascinating and formidable creatures 
         in the animal kingdom.

    <div class="card gila" >

      <p>
        The Gila monster (*Heloderma suspectum*) is one of only two venomous lizards in the world, the other being its close relative,
        the Mexican beaded lizard. Native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico,
        this striking reptile inhabits arid and semi-arid regions, including deserts, scrublands, and rocky foothills.
        Recognizable by its bold black-and-orange or black-and-pink beaded pattern, the Gila monster has a thick, stocky body,
        a broad head, and a short, fat tail that stores fat reserves for times of scarcity.
        Unlike snakes, which inject venom through hollow fangs, the Gila monster delivers its venom through grooves in its lower teeth,
        chewing the toxin into its prey while holding on with a powerful, vice-like grip.
        Although its venom is neurotoxic and can cause severe pain, swelling, and nausea in humans,
        fatalities are extremely rare due to the lizard's sluggish nature and reluctance to bite unless provoked.
        Primarily active during cooler months and at dawn or dusk to avoid extreme heat, the Gila monster feeds on small mammals, birds, eggs,
        and occasionally reptiles, relying on its keen sense of smell to locate prey. Despite its fearsome reputation, 
        this slow-moving lizard plays a vital role in its ecosystem and is protected by law in many areas due to habitat destruction and illegal 
        collection for the pet trade. With a lifespan of up to 20-30 years in the wild, 
        the Gila monster remains a fascinating and iconic symbol of the desert Southwest.
