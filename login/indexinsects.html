      <h2>BEES</h2>
      <p>Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their roles in pollination and,
         in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey.
          Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are currently considered a 
          clade, called Anthophila. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

      <h2>Ants</h2>
      <p>Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees,
         belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period.
          More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.

      <h2>Mosquito</h2>
      <p>Mosquitoes, the Culicidae, are a family of small flies consisting of 3,600 species.
         The word mosquito is Spanish and Portuguese for little fly. Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body,
          one pair of wings, three pairs of long hair-like legs, and specialized,
           highly elongated, piercing-sucking mouthparts.a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

         superfamily Papilionoidea, characterized by large,
         often brightly coloured wings that often fold
          together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight.

      <h2>Ladybugs</h2>
      <p>Coccinellidae is a widespread family of small beetles. They are commonly known as ladybugs
         in North America and ladybirds in the United Kingdom; "lady" refers to mother Mary.
          Entomologists use the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles to avoid confusion with true bugs.
